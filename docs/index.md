Hooker is a simple message routing application that receives input messages through a webhook interface, and can take enforce actions using predefined outputs via integrations.

Primary use of Hooker is to act as a message relay and notification service that integrates with a variety of third-party services. Hooker can also be used for sending vulnerability scan results or audit alerts from Khulnasoft Platform to collaboration systems.

In addition, Hooker can also be used to enforce pre-defined behaviours that can orchestrate actions based on input messages as triggers.
